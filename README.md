# CIEE_models
Models for CIEE working group at UBC, 4May-7May 2015

Research on measures for detecting and attributing biodiversity change. Contains code for reproducing the results for three different models of increasing complexity (marble, bci, and metacommunity). This project is part of a collaboration funded by the Canadian Institue for Ecology and Evolution, the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science, and sDiv. Models were discussed and formulated by members of the group and code was primarily written and edited by P. Thompson, R. Elahi, F. He, J. Chase, and S. Supp.

The code in this repository allow for the model results and figures to be fully replicated using simulated data. 

NOTE: The project and code in this repository is still under development. 

*Requirements:* R 3.x or higher, and the files containing data and functions specific to this code. 

*R Packages:* `cluster`, `FD`, `ggplot2`, `grid`, `picante`, `plyr`, `RColorBrewer`, `vegan`

The analyses can be replicated by ...

*Included Files*
